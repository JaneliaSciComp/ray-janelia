    """This wrappers allows calling methods of remote Ray actors (e.g. classes
    decorated with @ray.remote) as if they were local. It can be used to wrap
    classes from external libraries to simplify their integration with Ray.

    Example:

    @ray.remote
    class Counter():
        def __init__(self):
            self._counts = 0
        def increment(self, inc=1):

        def get_counts(self):
            return self._counts

    # Normal Ray usage (without this wrapper):
    counter = Counter.remote()  # Instantiate as remote.
    counter.increment.remote(inc=2)  # Call as remote.
    obj_ref = counter.get_counts.remote()  # Call as remote; returns a future.
    ray.get(obj_ref)  # Blocks and returns 2.

    # Using Ray with this wrapper:
    counter = Counter.remote()  # Instantiate as remote.
    counter = RemoteAsLocal(counter)  # Wrap.
    counter.increment(inc=2)  # Call as local.

    # Can be called to either return a future or block until call returns (the
    # latter is the default behavior):
    obj_ref = counter.get_counts(block=False)  # Call as local; returns a future.
    counter.get_counts(block=True)  # Call as local; blocks and returns 2.
